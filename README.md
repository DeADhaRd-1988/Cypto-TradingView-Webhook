## Quickstart

This is an introduction on how to set up your own Trading Bot.

First, we need to start the server that will listen for tradingview's webhooks. 

If you have no sever, heroku could helps you set up your own sever.

Second, configure your api key in config.py:

    API_KEY     = 'PUY_MY_API_KEY_HERE'
    API_SECRET  = 'PUY_MY_API_SECRET_HERE'

Last, set up your the webhook format on TradingView, it will look like json, here is an example:

    {"pair": "BTC-PERP", "side": "buy", "size": "0.01"}

Не забудьте использовать  app.env = "development"

Please make sure everthing is RIGHT, or you may lose your money！
